# Hospital Prices

We create visualizations and dashboards to enable the public and employers access the 4,000+ hospital price files we have collected thanks to a DoltHub data bounty (https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/onefact/paylesshealth).

Here are the 106,000+ prices listed by Mount Sinai, a major hospital with $2bn in revenue as an example: https://payless.health/hospital/mount-sinai
