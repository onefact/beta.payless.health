# Payless Health

We are reducing the price of health care using public data. We are a non-profit organization, and our mission is to help people and employers make decisions using public hospital and insurance prices about where to get affordable, high-quality care.

Here is a short video from the film [American Hospitals](https://fixithealthcare.com/watch/) with a brief overview of the high price of health care in the United States:

We have collected the prices from 4000 hospitals, and have published the data publicly at [https://data.payless.health/#hospital_price_transparency/](https://data.payless.health/#hospital_price_transparency/).

Our aim is to reduce the price of health care by enabling consumers and employers to find the best prices for their health care needs using this data. We are working toward this goal by building open-source tools to enable the public to access this data.

## Funding

We have received $135k of funding by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia and Stanford University (announcement [here](https://brown.columbia.edu/22-23-magic/)), [Patient Rights Advocate](https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/), and the [NIH AIM-AHEAD program](https://www.aim-ahead.net/) through which we have trained faculty at medical schools in the use of our data for health equity research. We are now seeking donations to continue our work. See [this page](/donate) on how to donate and support making this data public for all to access!
