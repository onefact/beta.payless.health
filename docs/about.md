# Payless Health

We are building a non-profit search engine to help you find the prices of every hospital in the country.

This can reduce the price of health care, by enabling consumers and employers to find the best prices for their health care needs.

We have collected the prices from 4000 hospitals, and have published the data publicly at [https://data.payless.health/#hospital_price_transparency/](https://data.payless.health/#hospital_price_transparency/).

## Funding

We have been funded by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia and Stanford University (announcement [here](https://brown.columbia.edu/22-23-magic/)), and [Patient Rights Advocate](https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/), and are now seeking donations to continue our work. See [this page](/donate) on how to donate and support making this data public for all to access! 

## Team 

Payless Health is built by One Fact Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization set up to build open-source tools for the public good. Our team includes patient advocates, data scientists, and software engineers, and we are based in New York City. You can read more about our team here: [https://onefact.org/team](https://onefact.org/team).

You can reach us by emailing [hello@payless.health](mailto:hello@payless.health).

We have also run an advertising campaign in NYC using this data; here is an example ad on the LinkNYC booth system near Times Square and Penn Station:
