# Donate to support Payless Health

We need your help in making a search engine for every hospital in the country.

We have collected the prices from 4000 hospitals, and have published the data publicly at [https://data.payless.health/#hospital_price_transparency/](https://data.payless.health/#hospital_price_transparency/).

We need your help in making this data searchable and usable for everyone, and all donations go towards this goal.

We have been funded by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia and Stanford University (announcement [here](https://brown.columbia.edu/22-23-magic/)), and [Patient Rights Advocate](https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/), and are now seeking donations to continue our work.
